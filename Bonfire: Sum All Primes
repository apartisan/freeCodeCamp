/*
Sum all the prime numbers up to and including the provided number.
A prime number is defined as having only two divisors, 1 and itself. For example, 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by 1 and 2. 1 isn't a prime number, because it's only divisible by itself.
The provided number may not be a prime.
Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck. Try to pair program. Write your own code.
